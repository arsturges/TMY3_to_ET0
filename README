This project contains files related to the LBL LDRD biofuels modeling project.

--A brief outline of the model--


The file tmy3_ruby1.9.rb parses TMY3 data files and produces the et0_output.csv.
et0_output.csv contains monthly weather data for 48 U.S. states. 
This file then becomes the input for the Excel file et0_calculations.xlsx.
The Excel file takes the monthly weather data for each state and calculates a monthly ET0 value for each state.
Those ET0 values then become the file /water_requirements/et0.csv.
The file /water_requirements/water_requirements_by_region.rb takes data from all of the files in /water_requirements (most of which hold data about crops) and outputs the file water_requirements_by_region.csv.
This file constitutes the major output of the model; it contains monthly irrigation requirements for various crops by month in 48 states.
