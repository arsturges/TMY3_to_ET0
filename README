This project contains files related to the LBL LDRD biofuels modeling project.

--A brief outline of the model--

The model touches the files in this order:
1. tmy3_ruby1.9.rb -- parses TMY3 data files and produces et0_output.csv.
2. et0_output.csv -- contains monthly weather data for 48 U.S. states. This file then becomes the input for the Excel file et0_calculations.xlsx.
3. et0_calculations.xlsx -- takes monthly weather data for each state and calculates a monthly ET0 value for each state. Those ET0 values then become the file /water_requirements/et0.csv.
4. et0.csv -- the output of the calculation dones by et0_calculations.xlsx.
5. /water_requirements/water_requirements_by_region.rb -- takes data from all of the files in /water_requirements (most of which hold data about crops) and outputs the file water_requirements_by_region.csv.
6. /water_requirement/water_requirements_by_region.csv -- constitutes the major output of the model; it contains monthly irrigation requirements for various crops by month in 48 states.
