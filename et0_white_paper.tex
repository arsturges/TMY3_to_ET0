\title{Computing Evapotranspiration Using TMY3 Weather Data}


\author{Andrew Sturges}

\maketitle

\section{Reference Evapotranspiration ($ET_{0}$)}

Evapotranspiration, expressed in units of water depth per unit time
(e.g. $\frac{mm}{day}$), is a combination of two separate processes
whereby water is lost on the one hand from the soil surface by evaporation
and on the other hand from the crop by transpiration \cite{FAO-56}.
For a given geographic location, a reference evapotranspiration, $ET_{0}$,
provides a relative indication of evapotranspiration losses, and thus,
irrigation needs. When multiplied by a crop coefficient $K_{c}$,
$ET_{0}$ yields the crop evapotranspiration $ET_{c}$, the actual
theoretical irrigation requirement of a given crop at a given location.

\begin{equation}
ET_{0}\ast K_{c}=ET_{c}\end{equation}



\subsection{The Penman-Monteith Equation}

$ET_{0}$ data for this report was calculated with the FAO Penman-Monteith
equation according to methods developed by the UN\textquoteright{}s
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Crop Evapotranspiration
\cite{FAO-56}. \begin{equation}
\frac{0.408\Delta(R_{n}-G)+\gamma\frac{900}{T+273}u_{2}(e_{s}-e_{a})}{\Delta+\gamma(1+0.34u_{2})}=ET_{0}\label{eq:Penman-Monteith}\end{equation}


This equation depends on solar radiation, air temperature, air humidity
and wind speed data. See table \ref{Flo:Penman Equation Variables}
for an explanation of the variables. All input data for the FAO Penman-Monteith
Equation came from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory\textquoteright{}s
(NREL) National Solar Radiation Database, commonly known as TMY3.

\subsection{TMY3 Data }

TMY3 data come from 1020 weather stations around the U.S. which record
climate parameters once every hour. To account for variability across
years (such as a particular year\textquoteright{}s unseasonably high
occurrence of hurricanes in the south), NREL developed a method of
choosing a reference year to represent each month of data in the TMY3
dataset for each individual weather station \cite{wilcox2008users}.
For example, January weather data from Gainesville, Florida, (station
ID 722146) comes from 1994 records, while February data comes from
1991 records. In this way, the TMY3 dataset aims to represent a typical
meteorological year (TMY). To arrive at the list of variables in table
\ref{Flo:Penman Equation Variables} requires calculations on more
fundamental input data. These, which come from TMY3, appear in table
\ref{Flo:TMY3 data inputs}.

\subsection{Scope }

Because this study is primarily concerned with large-scale agriculture,
most of which is found at elevations below 1000 meters (reference?
Use a USDA database?), the calculation only includes weather stations
at or below an elevation of 1000 meters. 

To estimate national crop yields, this study limits its scope to state-level
data. For TMY3 data, this means that primary data from all weather
stations in a given state are compiled and averaged by month to come
up with the inputs for each $ET_{0}$ calculation. This averaging
effectively creates one hypothetical master weather station for each
state, with a representative latitude and elevation. 


\subsection{Variables }

Treatment of the FAO Penman-Monteith equation and derivation of its
constituent variables was done according to the methods laid out in
Crop evapotranspiration \cite{FAO-56}. However, the following variables
deserve discussion beyond what is provided in Crop evapotranspiration. 


\subsubsection{$T_{max}$ and $T_{min}$ }

Temperature data in TMY3 is recorded every hour, and used in the FAO
Penman-Monteith equation to calculate saturation vapor pressure $e_{s}$.
To calculate $T_{max}$, we record the daily high for each day in
a given month, and then compute the average of those daily highs.\[
\frac{\sum_{1}^{d}\mbox{daily high temperature}}{d}=T_{max}\]
where $d$ is the number of days in the month. Substituting the daily
low temperature for the daily high temperature leads to the equation
for the average daily low.


\subsubsection{Soil Heat Flux Density (G) }

Some portion of solar radiation is utilized in heating the soil. $G$
is positive when the soil is warming and negative when the soil is
cooling. The soil heat flux density for a given month depends on whether
the average temperature during that month is greater or less than
the average temperature of the previous month. For example, the average
temperature in June is typically greater than the average temperature
in May, so the net soil heat flux is positive. The temperature in
November is typically cooler than the temperature in October, so the
soil heat flux is negative. We compute average temperature for each
month by state. Because we have a single calendar month, for February
through December, G is computed using average temperature as described
above. For January, we use average temperature data from the following
(priod?) December. 


\subsubsection{$T_{dew}$}

Dew point temperature is used in the calculation of actual vapor pressure.
To calculate the average dew point temperature for a given month,
we take the average of all the dew point readings, which are taken
every hour:

\[
\frac{\sum_{1}^{h}\mbox{hourly dew point temperature}}{h}=T_{dew}\]
where $h$ is the number of hours in the month.


\subsubsection{Elevation ($z$) }

Elevation is used in the calculation of the psychrometric constant
($\gamma$), which relies intermediately on atmospheric pressure.
Because all weather stations in a given state are averaged together,
the resulting {}``master weather station'' is given an elevation
calculated from the unweighted averages of all of that state\textquoteright{}s
weather stations.

\[
\frac{\sum_{1}^{s}\mbox{elevation}}{s}=z\]
where $s$ is the number of weather stations in the state.


\subsubsection{Wind speed ($u_{2}$)}

The FAO Penman-Monteith Equation \eqref{eq:Penman-Monteith} relies
directly on wind speed in both the numerator and the denominator.
Hourly wind speed for a given weather station is averaged over each
day, and wind speed for a given month is the average of its constituent
days. Therefore a month\textquoteright{}s wind speed is effectively
the average of all of its hourly wind speed recordings: 

\[
\frac{\sum_{1}^{h}(\mbox{hourly wind speed})_{h}}{h}=u_{2}\]
 where $h$ is the number of hours in the month and $(\mbox{hourly wind speed})_{h}$
is the wind speed during hour $h$.


\subsubsection{Latitude }

Latitude is used in the calculation of net radiation $R_{n}$. Like
elevation, latitude is averaged together over all weather stations
to come up with a latitude for the state\textquoteright{}s hypothetical
master weather station.

\[
\frac{\sum_{1}^{s}\mbox{latitude}_{s}}{s}=latitude\]
where $s$ is the number of weather stations in the state, and $latitude_{s}$
is the latitude of weather station $s$.


\subsubsection{Sunshine duration ($n$) }

Net radiation ($R_{n}$) relies on a ratio of actual sunshine duration
($n$ hours) to possible sunshine duration ($N$ hours). A day with
no cloud cover would have an $n:N$ ratio of 1, with an increase in
cloud cover reducing this ratio. The World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) defines sunshine duration during a given period as the sum of
that sub-period for which the direct solar irradiance exceeds $120\frac{W}{m^{2}}$
\cite{wmo2008}. In a given day, there may be 14 or more hours (depending
on latitude) during which direct solar irradiance exceeds this number,
or as few as zero. For a particular day, $n$ is the number of hours
for which direct solar irradiance is greater than $120\frac{W}{m^{2}}$.
Because TMY3 provides direct solar irradiation data, monthly sunshine
duration ($n$) is calculated as the average of a given month\textquoteright{}s
daily sunshine durations.

\[
\sum_{1}^{d}(\mbox{sunshine duration})_{d}=n\]
 where $d$ is the number of days in the month, and $(\mbox{sunshine duration})_{d}$
is the number of hours during day $d$ during which direct solar irradiance
was greater than $120\frac{W}{m^{2}}$.


\subsection{Calculation }

The primary input variables listed above are calculated by state and
by month for a total of 600 rows for each of three elevation bands.
These are fed to an Excel spreadsheet which performs the intermediary
calculations outlined in Crop evapotranspiration.
